# TinySets

A partial implementation of *tiny sets* (parts of 8) and *tiny
relations* (on tiny sets, aka parts of 8тип8), to be complemented with
*tiny maps* (between tiny sets), all encoded in Julia as "bits types".

The purpose of this code is conceptual exploration and self-education.
In particular, the author has absolutely no intention to expand to
bigger sets, ever. Because that would be quite beside the point.
