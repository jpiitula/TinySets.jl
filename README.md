# TinySets

A partial implementation of *tiny sets* (parts of 8) with *tiny maps*
and *tiny relations* (parts of products) between them.

The purpose of this code is conceptual exploration and self-education.
In particular, the author has no intention to expand to bigger sets.
That would be a quite different project.
